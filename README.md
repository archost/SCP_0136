**Item #:** SCP-0136  

**Object Class:** Euclid  

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
SCP-0136 is to be contained within the ventilation system of the Intercollegiate Campus Building (ICB-14), which has been acquired under Foundation cover as a disused academic facility. All access points to the ventilation shafts must remain locked and monitored by motion sensors. Personnel entering ICB-14 for maintenance or research purposes must be accompanied by at least one armed guard.  

Any sightings of SCP-0136 outside its designated containment area are to be reported immediately. Attempts to lure or extract SCP-0136 from the ventilation system require prior approval from Level 3 personnel.  

**Description:**  
SCP-0136 is a humanoid entity identifying itself as "Oleg" (believed to be a former maintenance worker of ICB-14). SCP-0136 exhibits an anomalous ability to navigate and reside within the building's ventilation network despite its narrow and structurally unstable passages.  

SCP-0136 is highly elusive and avoids direct contact with personnel, though it has been observed watching through grates and whispering to individuals who pass beneath. Recorded speech consists primarily of fragmented Russian phrases, pleas for "quiet," and warnings about "them" (unidentified, possibly delusional).  

Subjects who spend extended periods near SCP-0136’s hiding spots report auditory hallucinations (scratching, muffled crying) and an irrational compulsion to avoid looking upward. Three (3) instances of personnel attempting to access SCP-0136’s location have resulted in sudden structural collapses within the vents, suggesting either defensive anomalous influence or extreme coincidence.  

**Addendum 0136-1:**  
On ██/██/20██, surveillance captured SCP-0136 briefly exiting the vents in an unused laboratory. The entity appeared malnourished, clad in torn work overalls, and repeatedly checked over its shoulder before retreating. DNA analysis of recovered hair samples matched no known records.  

**Addendum 0136-2:**  
Research into ICB-14’s history revealed that a maintenance worker named Oleg S. went missing in 199█ after reporting "something moving in the vents." No further investigation was conducted at the time. Whether SCP-0136 is Oleg S. or an entity assuming his identity remains unclear.  

**Note:** *Until we determine whether it’s hostile, trapped, or just really likes vents, assume it’s all three. And for God’s sake, stop leaving food near the grates—it’s learning to ask for cigarettes now.* — Dr. █████
